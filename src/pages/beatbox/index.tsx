            <p className="fs-400 clr-neutral-500">
              "BeatBox-VR" is a virtual reality drumming experience that allows
              players to play and interact with a full drum set in a 3D
              environment. Inspired by the power of music and the immersive
              capabilities of VR technology, our objective was to create a game
              that not only teaches the fundamentals of drumming but also
              provides an entertaining platform for advanced musicians to
              practice and perform.
